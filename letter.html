    <h1>My Letter For You My Love</h1>
    <p class="letter"> Hello love, first of all happy valentines, although this is our 2nd offifial valentines, I would
        still like to include the first one making this our 3rd hehe. Lou I know that this year havent been easy
        for you, for me, and for our relationship. Whether it's personal or whether it's about the two of us. So 
        I would like to first thank you for staying strong, for continuing to fight. I know how hard it has been for you 
        especially with you being alone most of the time, thats why I am so proud of you love and how happy I am. You've 
        come so far, grow so much to the point that you have left your past left to being merely memories now. 
        I know some things have changed, that some things are no longer the same as it was before whether it's the presence 
        of someone, whether it's the actions, the time, the environment but such things are the nature 
        of time. And things will only continue changing, we just have to change accordingly with it. Anything or 
        even everything may change, but one thing that won's is my love for you. The future 
        is coming love, more difficulties are heading at your way and at mine. But I promise you this, we will 
        face them together as we always have. Thank you for everything you have given me, especially your love 
        I hope and wish that I have gave and am giving you the love that is equal to what you give to me. 
        ou Lou is one of the greatest things I have recieved in my life, and I will always be thankful for you, 
        for your parents, for the people you grew up with and mose especially to God for bringing you here. 
        I know that we aren't always the lovey dovey and happy couple, but it is something that can never be avoided, 
        for that if we are always loving and happy then it will mean that something is wrong. It is the same rule 
        that applies to everyone afterall. Please know that although sometimes I don't say it, that sometimes it 
        doesnt reach you, please know that you are the person I want to marry, the person I want to grow old with, 
        the person I plan the future with. I can't imagine a life without you for you are one of the someone who makes my very life 
        run. I will always, always be thankful for you, and will always love you and everything about you, flaws or not. 
        Lou, you have always been the only one, you've always looked pretty to me, with makeup or not. Yes, I admit that sometimes 
        my words alone is not enough but please always belive me when I say that okay? The future is will always 
        remain untold which makes it frightening but Nevertheless I want to spend it with you and you alone. Throughout the year 
        I have made countless letters to you, but none will never large enough to contain all my love for you Happy Valentines Love, 
        I will always Love and will always choose you.
    </p>
